This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
App inspired by Simon Bloom's Fun Food Friends

## Scope Outline:

This app was created initially for Salad Club day at HackerYou, giving users the ability to log what they will be bringing.
I have changed it to a more versatile item recording app for multiple users. This app can be used for pot lucks, boardgame nights, sporting events, etc..

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Goals:

To successfully have multiple users log what items they are bringing, with a remove item option as well.
